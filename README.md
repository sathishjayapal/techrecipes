# Tech Recipes Repo

This is a repo am planning to build for the next 365 days. Inspired by this [blog](https://medium.com/@jackiehluo/a-year-of-code-c7bc1d4460cb#.27835u871). Most of the sample are from the Java 8 videos in [agile learner](https://www.agilelearner.com). It is a subscription service. But great presentations and lessons.
